## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, 

I had so much fun creating my own portfolio website and adding all the work I have done and are most proud of to show to everyone. 


## Lessons Learned:

I never felt like my porfolio website was enough so i constantly would add small things to it just to make it a bit better. I added the neon social link buttons towards the end and learned quite a bit in that process. I made sure to mess around with the color schemes to see what would have the best fit. I spent a decent amount of time learning which colors fit best with others. My favorite thing I learned from this project was working with the footer to add a waves affect. I had trouble with the height and empty space but figured it out and love the way it looks at the moment.
